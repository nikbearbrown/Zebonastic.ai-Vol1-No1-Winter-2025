## The /shorten Command: Streamlining Your Prompts

The /shorten command helps simplify long, complex prompts while maintaining their essential elements. This tool is invaluable for understanding which aspects of your prompts are most impactful.

![Shorten](https://github.com/nikbearbrown/Zebonastic.ai-Vol1-No1-Winter-2025/raw/68aecff51cd0dfd57e1fbac37f6fd086d1c78551/Art/shorten.png)


### How It Works
```markdown
1. Start with a detailed prompt
2. Use /shorten command
3. Receive multiple shortened versions
4. Compare effectiveness
```

## Practical Application

### Example Process:
```markdown
Original Prompt:
"a professional corporate office interior with modern furniture, natural lighting through large windows, minimalist design aesthetic, warm color palette, wide angle view, architectural photography style"

Shortened Versions:
1. "modern corporate office, natural light, minimalist design, architectural photo"
2. "minimalist office interior, warm tones, wide angle"
3. "professional office space, modern aesthetic"
```

## Benefits of Shortened Prompts

1. **Efficiency**
   - Faster generation
   - Clearer focus
   - Easier iteration
   - Better workflow

2. **Learning**
   - Identify key elements
   - Understand priorities
   - Refine technique
   - Improve prompt writing

## Best Practices

### When to Use /shorten
```markdown

   - Note differences
   - Document effectiveness
   - Build knowledge base

2. **Iterative Approach**
   - Start simple
   - Add complexity
   - Test variations
   - Optimize results

## The Art of Prompt Efficiency: Why Less Can Be More

When crafting prompts for Midjourney, it's crucial to understand that more words don't necessarily mean better results. Like a crowded room where too many voices make it hard to hear the important ones, overly complex prompts can cause the AI to focus inconsistently on different elements.

### The Problem with Verbose Prompts
```markdown
Example of an Overcrowded Prompt:
"a sleek modern minimalist tech startup office space with natural bamboo furniture and floor-to-ceiling windows, bathed in warm morning sunlight, with employees working collaboratively, featuring clean lines and a Scandinavian design aesthetic, with indoor plants and geometric art pieces on the walls"

Issues:
- Competing focal points
- Inconsistent interpretation
- Unpredictable emphasis
- Variable results
```

## Building Stable Prompts

### The Essential Elements Approach
```markdown
Refined Version:
"minimalist tech office, natural light, Scandinavian design"

Benefits:
- Clear primary focus
- Consistent interpretation
- Reliable results
- Faster generation
```

### Example Transformations

1. **Product Photography**
```markdown
Verbose:
"luxury leather wallet photographed on a marble surface with professional studio lighting, showing fine stitching details and premium craftsmanship, with subtle shadows and reflections, brand logo visible, commercial photography style"

Stable:
"luxury leather wallet, marble surface, studio lighting, commercial photography"
```

2. **Brand Identity**
```markdown
Verbose:
"modern corporate logo design with abstract geometric shapes flowing dynamically, incorporating shades of deep blue and silver, suggesting technology and innovation, with clean lines and professional appearance"

Stable:
"modern tech logo, geometric, blue and silver, minimal"
```

## Pro Tips

1. **Essential Terms Only**
- Keep core descriptors
- Remove redundant words
- Maintain key style indicators
- Include critical technical specs

2. **Test for Stability**
- Run multiple generations
- Compare consistency
- Document variations
- Refine as needed

## Understanding Midjourney Parameters: Aspect Ratio and Beyond

# Understanding Technical Jargon in AI Prompts
*Zebonastic.ai Vol. 1 No. 1 - Winter 2025*

## The Power of Technical Terminology

Technical jargon serves as a form of information compression in prompts. When you use technical terms, you're leveraging the AI's comprehensive understanding of industry-specific concepts to communicate more efficiently.

### Example: Photography Terms
```markdown
Verbose Prompt:
"a portrait where the background is softly blurred in a pleasing way while keeping the subject sharp and clear"

Jargon-Based Prompt:
"portrait, shallow DOF, bokeh effect, f/1.8"
```

## Information Density in Practice

### Photography
```markdown
Dense Terms:
- Bokeh
- Golden hour
- Rembrandt lighting
- Rule of thirds
- chromatic aberration

Example Prompt:
"corporate headshot, Rembrandt lighting, 85mm, bokeh"
```

### Artistic Styles
```markdown
Dense Terms:
- Chiaroscuro
- Impasto
- Sfumato
- Trompe l'oeil
- Cross-hatching

Example Prompt:
"still life, chiaroscuro, impasto technique"
```

## Benefits of Technical Language

1. **Precision**
   - Exact technical meaning
   - Industry-standard terms
   - Specific effects
   - Professional results

2. **Efficiency**

2. Learn technical concepts
3. Understand techniques
4. Practice implementation
```

### Combining Technical Terms
```markdown
Example Prompts:
Portrait: "clamshell lighting, OCF, medium format, Kodak Portra"
Architecture: "golden ratio, leading lines, wide angle, HDR"
```

## Basic Template Structure

Midjourney prompts have several core components that act as building blocks for generating specific outputs. Understanding and mastering these elements is key to building effective templates.

### Core Components:

1. **Subject**
   - **Main Focus**: The core object, character, or element in the image.
   - **Key Attributes**: Details like color, age, or defining features.
   - **Actions/Poses**: The behavior or posture of the subject.

2. **Environment**
   - **Setting**: The context or location where the subject exists.
   - **Lighting Conditions**: Natural light, studio setup, dramatic contrasts, etc.
   - **Atmosphere**: The mood or emotional tone of the scene.

3. **Style**
   - **Artistic Medium**: Photorealism, oil painting, digital art, etc.
   - **Technical Approach**: Level of abstraction, realism, or surrealism.
   - **Reference Artists**: Specific styles (e.g., Van Gogh, Moebius).

4. **Technical Parameters**
   - **Aspect Ratio**: Frame dimensions (e.g., --ar 16:9 for widescreen).
   - **Image Quality**: Defines rendering detail (--q 1 to --q 5).
   - **Style Weights**: Degree of influence (--s 0-1000).

3. Analyze the differences in mood, tone, and detail.

---

### Exercise 2: Mood Development
Use the same subject and environment but experiment with different emotional tones.

**Template**:
```plaintext
"[subject] in [environment], [lighting], [mood]"
```

**Examples**:
1. **Peaceful**: "Sleeping Beauty resting in her enchanted castle, morning sunlight, tranquil mood, soft pastel colors"
2. **Dramatic**: "Hercules battling the Nemean Lion in a rocky gorge, stormy skies, intense mood, high-contrast lighting"
3. **Mysterious**: "a shadowy figure of the Pied Piper leading children through a misty forest, eerie atmosphere, muted tones"

---

### Exercise 3: Technical Parameter Testing
Experiment with different parameters to understand their impact.

1. **Quality Testing**:
   - "--q 1": Faster generation with basic details.
   - "--q 2": Higher detail for intricate images.

2. **Style Weights**:
   - "--s 50": Subtle stylistic influence.
   - "--s 750": Strong adherence to a specific style.

3. **Chaos Testing**:

```
**Example**:
- "a depiction of Icarus soaring towards the sun in the style of Michelangelo meets Hayao Miyazaki, oil painting with anime influences"

---

### Emphasizing Specific Elements
Use weight modifiers (`::`) for emphasis.
```plaintext
/imagine "Medusa ::2, with her snake hair ::1, in the style of Art Nouveau" --ar 2:3
```
